# chess-system-java

Chess game made interely in java.

This project is part of an POO Udemy course, which helped me to have a better vision about the java attributes, classes and methods
In this project I worked and improved my knowledges in:
- Encapsulation
- Constructors
- ToString
- Associations
- Matrix
- Enumerations
- Inheritance
- Static members
- Downcasting
- Layers pattern
- Overriding
- Polymorphism
- Exceptions
- Abstract method / class
- Overloading
- Lists
- English (comments and variable/class names)

This application counts with the entire chess experience, moves for specific pieces, special moves (an passant, castling and promotion) and all kind of exception treatment.
